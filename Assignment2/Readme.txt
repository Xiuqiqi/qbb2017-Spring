Problem 1

The protein I used:  gi|1015882853

All the alignments have dashes in the end.


Problem 2

FASTA: For each entry, tne description line, other lines are raw sequences.

PHYLIP: First line is two numbers, number of sequences and length of the alignments 
	The file has 6 columns. First column is the name of the sequences, in 10 characters, appearing only once.
	Columns 2-6 are raw sequences, each column has 10 characters. The entries appear in parallel, starting a new 
	section after 50 characters with an empty line to seperate.


Problem 3
Model of amino-acids substitution  LG
Amino acid frequencies (empirical/model defined)  model
Gamma distributed rates across sites  yes             
Gamma distribution parameter (fixed/estimated)  estimated
Proportion of invariable sites (fixed/estimated)  fixed (p-invar = 0.00)
